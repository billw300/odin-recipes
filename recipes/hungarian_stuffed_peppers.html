        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 bell peppers</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 cup rice, rinsed and parboiled</li>
            <li>1 large egg beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sweet or hot Hungarian paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 (8-ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>Sour cream, for garnish, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash peppers.
                Cut off tops and remove seeds.
                Season cavities lightly with salt and pepper.
                Finally chop pepper tops and place in large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add onion, ground chuck, pork, parboiled rice, egg, paprika, salt, pepper and garlic to the bowl containing the pepper tops.
                Mix well.</li>
            <li>Stuff peppers lightly with meat mixture because the rice will expand.
                If you have any leftover meat filling, form it into meatballs.</li>
            <li>Place stuffed peppers and any meatballs in a small slow cooker.
                Mix together tomato sauce and sugar and pour over peppers.
                Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours.
                This also can be cooked in a 350 F oven for 1 hour or on the stovetop for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Serve peppers with a dollop of sour cream, if desired, and crusty white or freeze well if covered with sauce</li> 
        </ol>
