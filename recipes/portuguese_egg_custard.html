        <li>Combine flour, salt, and cold water in a bowel.
            Mix with a wooden spoon until dough just comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
            Dough should be sticky.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough onto a well-floured surface. Dust a little more flour over the top.
            Knead for 1 to 2 minutes to form a round.
            Cover and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a square about 1/8-inch-thick, dusting with flour as necessary; dough should still be sticky</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the square using a silicone spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border.
            Flip the unbuttered side over the middle of the square and fold the opposite end over it like a letter.
            Straigten the edges as needed.</li>
        <li>Turn dough with a bench scraper to unstick it from the counter; dust with flour.
            Flip and sprinkle more flour on top.
            Roll dough into a 1/8-inch-thick rectangle, carefully stretching edges as needed.
            Spread another 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the dough. 
            Fold into thirds.
            Transfer onto a lined baking sheet and freeze until butter is slightly chilled, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle sough with flour and roll into a square a little over 1/8-inch-thick.
            Spread remaining butter over the dough, leaving a 1-to-1 1/2-inch border on the top edge.
            Dip your finger in water and lightly moisten the unbuttered edge.
            Roll  dough into a log starting from the bottom edge.
            Dust with more flour and polish the ends as needed.
            Seal with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water, cinnamon, and lemon zest in a pot.
            Boil over medium heat, without stirring, until syrup reaches 210 to 215 degrees F (100 degrees C).</li>
            Remove from heat.
        <li>Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C).
            Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, salt, and cold milk together very thoroughly in a cold pot.
            Cook over medium heat,whisking constantly, until milk thickens, about 5 minutes.
            Remove from heat and let cool for at least 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks into the cooled milk.
            Add sugar syrup and vanilla extract.
            Mix until combined.
            Strain custard into a glass measuring cup.</li>
        <li>Unwrap the dough and trim any uneven bits on the ends.
            Score log into 12 even pieces using a knife; cut through.</li>
        <li>Place a piece of dough in each muffin cup.
            Dip your thumb lightly in some cold water.
            Press your thumb into the center of the swirl; push dough against the bottom and up the sides of the cup until it reaches least 1/8 inch past the top.</li>
        <li>Fill each cup 3/4 of the way with custard.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is browned and bubbly, and the tops start to blister and carmelize, about 12 minutes.</li>
